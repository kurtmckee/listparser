listparser.py - Parse subscription lists into a consistent format.
Copyright (C) 2009 Kurt McKee <contactme@kurtmckee.org>

listparser is a Python library that parses subscription lists (also
called reading lists) and returns all of the feeds and subscription
lists that it finds. It supports OPML, RDF+FOAF, and the iGoogle
exported settings format.


Usage
=====

>>> import listparser
>>> result = listparser.parse( \
... 'http://github.com/kurtmckee/listparser/raw/master/project.opml')

A dictionary will be returned with several keys:
`meta`: a dictionary of information about the subscription list
`feeds`: a list of feeds
`lists`: a list of subscription lists
`version`: a file format identifier
`bozo`: 1 if there is a problem with the list, 0 otherwise
`bozo_exception`: (if `bozo` is 1) a description of the problem

Continuing the example:

>>> result.meta.title
u'listparser project feeds'
>>> len(result.feeds)
3
>>> result.feeds[0].keys()
['url', 'title']

More extensive documentation is available in the docs/ directory.


Bugs
====

There are going to be bugs. The best way to handle them will be to
isolate the simplest possible document that susses out the bug, add
that document as a test case, and then find and fix the problem.

...you can also just report the bug and leave it to someone else
to fix the problem, but that won't be as much fun for you.

Bugs can be reported at <http://github.com/kurtmckee/listparser/issues>

=================

Python support
--------------

*   Support Python 3.11 and 3.12.
*   Drop support for Python 3.7.

Added
-----

*   Add a ``py.typed`` file so mypy can lint listparser use in dependent applications.
*   Support lxml v5.0.0 while maintaining support for v4.6.2.

Changed
-------

*   Support malformed XML documents by using lxml's HTML parsers.

Fixed
-----

*   Fix the feed URL to the blog entries about listparser.

Documentation
-------------

*   Add the OPML 1.0 and OPML 2.0 specifications to the listparser documentation for posterity.

Development
-----------

*   Randomize the order of listparser's unit tests on each run
    to help ensure there are no testing interdependencies.
*   Add black, flake8, and isort as pre-commit hooks.
*   Add mypy as a tox test environment.
*   Add pyupgrade as a pre-commit hook and enforce Python 3.8+ syntax.
*   Python warnings encountered during testing are now escalated to errors.
*   Move tool dependencies into separate ``requirements.txt`` files.
*   Add a tox label, ``update``, so it's easy to update tool dependencies.

0.19 - 2022-06-04
=================

*"Spring cleaning"*

Added
-----

*   Add ``requests`` as an optional dependency.
*   Add ``lxml`` as an optional dependency.
    This is currently the only way to parse malformed XML files.
*   Add support for Python 3.7 through Python 3.10.

Removed
-------

*   Drop support for CPython 3.6 and lower.
*   Drop support for IronPython.
*   Drop support for Jython.
*   Remove some ancient Jython compatibility code.
*   HTML entities are no longer automatically injected into the DTD.

    If ``lxml`` is installed and undeclared HTML entities are encountered,
    they will be ignored.

    If lxml is not installed and undeclared HTML entities are encountered,
    Python's ``xml.sax`` parser will fail to parse the document.

Fixed
-----

*   Fix some coverage messages that were output during testing.
*   Fix the combined coverage HTML report's paths.

Changed
-------

*   Migrate to a ``src/``-based directory structure.
*   Migrate to Read the Docs for documentation hosting.
*   ``parse()`` no longer accepts *etag*, *modified*, or *agent* arguments.
*   HTTP response information is no longer available in the return dictionary.
*   The unit tests no longer launch an HTTP server.
*   Coverage data is now erased before the unit tests begin.
*   ``bozo`` is now ``True`` or ``False``, not ``1`` or ``0``.
*   ``bozo_exception`` is guaranteed to exist in the return dict.
*   The RFC 822 parser now returns timezone-aware ``datetime`` objects
    instead of converting to UTC and losing timezone info.
*   Move and split ``lptest.py`` into the ``tests/`` subdirectory
    and into specific ``test_*`` files.
*   Increased test coverage reporting to include test runners.
*   Decreased the number of ``tox`` environments where listparser must be built and installed.
*   Internally rely on ``dict`` key-based lookups instead of ``SuperDict`` attribute-based lookups.
*   Cache XML parsing method lookup results to avoid excessive string formatting.
*   Change the name of the ``ListError`` to ``ListparserError``.
*   Split the codebase into multiple files.
*   Use ``tox`` to automate testing across multiple interpreters and versions.
*   Migrate to ``pytest`` for unit testing.
*   Remove dependence on the ``six`` package.
*   Add type annotations.
*   Remove compatibility code.
*   Migrate to Poetry and ``pyproject.toml`` for project configuration.
*   Change the license from LGPLv3 to MIT.
*   Use scriv to manage the CHANGELOG.

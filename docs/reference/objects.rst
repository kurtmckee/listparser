Shared object properties
========================

Feed, subscription list, and opportunity objects share several common
properties. Although the content may come from different elements in
the source document, the information is stored in consistent attributes.

Wherever you see ``objects[i]`` in these documents
you can substitute ``feeds[i]``, ``lists[i]``, or ``opportunities[i]``.

Welcome to listparser's documentation!
======================================

listparser is a Python library that parses subscription lists (also called reading lists) and returns all of the feeds, subscription lists, and "opportunity" URLs that it finds. It supports OPML, RDF+FOAF, and the iGoogle exported settings format.

listparser has been tested and runs on Python 2.4 and up, Python 3.0, and Jython 2.5.1.
